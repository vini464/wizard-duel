# Wizard Duel

A virtual card game inspired by Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone. Open boosters, create your
deck and use your cards to obliterate your enemies in 1v1 games.

## How to Play

First open some boosters. Each one has five cards:

* 3 common * 1 uncommon * 1 rare or mythical

Then build your deck with a total of 20 cards, a deck can only have 3 copies of the same card.

Now that you have a playable game, let's learn how a game turn works:

### Phase One - Refill

- Here all your Crystals regain Energy, and you gain a new Crystal each turn.

### Phase Two - Draw

- You draw a card from your deck.

### Phase Three - Main

- Here you cast your spells, until you're out of Energy or you skip the phase.

### Phase Four - Maintenance

- You should only keep at most six cards on your hand, if there are more than that, discard
them as you wish.

### Phase Five - End

- Nothing to do, just pass your turn to your opponent

Now let's stablish some rules:

 1. The game is played 1v1.
 2. Each player begins with 10 Health Points (HP) and 10 Shield Points (SP).
 3. Each player begins with 5 cards.
 4. Whoever starts the game skip their Draw phase.
 5. Each player begins with 0 Crystals.
 6. The damage is dealt to the PS and the remaining is dealt to the HP.
 7. The damage dealt to the SP is permanent.
 8. All spells can only be played at your Main phase.
 9. If you don't have any cards in your Deck or your hand you lose 1 HP
10. If your HP gets down to 0 you lose the game.
